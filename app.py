    ## ðŸ“± Smartphone Addiction Predictor
    This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a person is likely addicted to their smartphone based on their usage patterns. The features used for prediction are based on common behaviors that may indicate smartphone addiction.

    ### Features Used for Prediction:
    - **Phone Usage for Notes**: Do you use your phone to click pictures of class notes?
    - **Accessing Books via Mobile**: Do you buy or access books on your mobile device?
    - **Battery Life**: Does your phone's battery last throughout the day?
    - **Phone Charging Habits**: Do you rush to charge your phone when its battery dies?
    - **Fear of Losing Phone**: Do you feel anxious about losing your phone?
    - **Phone in the Bathroom**: Do you take your phone with you to the bathroom?

    ### Model and Prediction:
    The model uses the above behaviors to classify whether a user is likely to be addicted to their smartphone. A prediction result of `1` indicates potential addiction, while a result of `0` suggests no addiction.

    ### About the Technology:
    The model is built using supervised machine learning techniques, specifically trained on user data collected from various behavioral patterns related to smartphone usage.

    ### Purpose of the Project:
    The goal is to help individuals understand their phone usage patterns and the potential impact of excessive screen time on their daily lives. It can be used as a tool for self-awareness or to guide recommendations for healthier smartphone habits.

    ## Logistic Regression Algorithm

    **Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the output is either 0 or 1. In this project, we use logistic regression to predict whether a user is likely addicted to their smartphone based on their behavioral patterns.

    ### How it Works:
    - **Logistic function (Sigmoid function)**: The core of logistic regression is the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, which transforms any input into a probability between 0 and 1.
    - **Training Process**: The model learns the relationship between input features (like phone usage patterns) and the target variable (addiction status) by finding the best-fitting line or curve that minimizes the error in predictions.
    - **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can predict the likelihood of addiction based on the input features provided by the user.

    ### Why Logistic Regression:
    Logistic regression is simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification tasks like this one. It also provides probabilities, which can be useful for understanding the confidence level of predictions.
